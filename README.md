# Iris-SVM-Classification
This project uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify iris flower species based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It covers loading and inspecting the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing the data, training the SVM model, and evaluating its performance.
